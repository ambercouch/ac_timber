              <p>I had been to a couple of shops before I came to Angharad Bridal, so glad I did as not only did I find my dress I also found my bridesmaids dresses to! Angharad was so nice and helpful, really couldn’t have asked for better. Would highly reccomend, the shop is beautiful. Thank you again 😘xxx</p>

              <p>What a great experience it was coming to Angharad Bridal shop. There was a dress I wanted to try on that wasn't currently in the shop but they kindly sourced it for me and got it posted up from London to their shop. They made the whole process so easy. The layout of the shop is fantastic and I loved how my family and I got to go round the shop picking out dresses ourselves. Angharad was so kind and patient. When I found my dress she let my family and I have time to ourselves so that we could discuss the dress and at no point did I feel under pressure. I'm so glad I found my wedding dress at Angharad Bridal. You are all terrific, thank you for a fantastic experience in finding my wedding dress!</p>

              <p>I can't recommend Angharad Bridal enough!!
Angharad was the first shop I went to go shopping for a wedding dress. I was pretty nervous because I didn't have a clue what style etc I wanted... As soon as I walked into the shop and was greeted by Angahard, I knew I had no reason to be nervous because she was absolutely brilliant and set me right at ease. The tea/water/juice was constantly being refilled :) I didn't feel rushed at any point or pressured to buy a dress there and then... I ended up trying on about 11 dresses, some 2 or 3 times each. Angharad gave me some suggestions to try on and she could tell straight away if I wasn't keen or if it was a 'maybe'.

After nearly 2 and a half hours of trying on dresses, I fell in love with a dress and it made me feel beautiful. I didn't expect to leave with a dress at all so I'm extremely excited I've found THE ONE already, all thanks to Angharad! Thank you so much!</p>

I went in thinking I wouldn’t like anything and that I wasn’t going to try anything on, I ended up trying on about 9 different ones and saying yes to the dress!</p>
              <p>Never would I of thought that would happen. Angharad was so helpful, warm and caring and made you feel so relaxed and comfortable, they did an amazing job at helping me find something and put together that perfect dress. I left the shop yesterday on cloud 9 and can not wait to go back to try my dress back on. Thank you so much ladies, you made one very nervous bride to be very happy and excited!</p>

            <p>Amazing shop with perfect customer service. I had an appointment booked which Mhairi (i think was her name) helped me through, I was completely torn between 2 dresses and may have slightly ran over my appointment time, this was no problem and there was no feeling of rushing me out the door. Got home to stress about whether I had picked the right dress and Angharad very kindly came in on her day off to put my mind at ease and try them on again. Highly recommend not only for the beautiful dresses but for the kindness of the people who work there/own it. Pictures on every dress are a god send. Can’t thank you both enough! X</p>
